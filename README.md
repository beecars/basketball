# basketball

this is just a little program I wrote to graphically display box scores against a 
distributional violin plot of past performance. 

it accesses data from the NBA reference database. the database is only "defacto" 
public, and the required api calls change from time to time. 

the nba-api package (https://github.com/swar/nba_api) tries to keep up to date with the changes to api endpoints.
